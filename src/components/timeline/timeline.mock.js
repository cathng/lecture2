      excerpt: 'The annual Chrism Mass never used to make sense to me. It seemed rather disjointed. There is the renewal of priestly promises and then, the reason Chrism Mass is called Chrism Mass, the blessing of the oils and consecration of Chrism. At first glance, these two actions don’t seem related. Then, I’m reminded that the Church is smarter than I am and she knows what she is doing.',
